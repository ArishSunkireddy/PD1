# Playlist Personality

A Spotify-powered app that analyzes your music taste to uncover your personality traits using OpenAI's GPT model.

This project lets users paste a Spotify playlist URL into a visually branded GUI (styled like Spotify), fetches song titles from the playlist using the Spotify API, and sends them to OpenAI's API for personality analysis. The result is a uniquely human, introspective breakdown of your musical identity.
